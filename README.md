# MPU6050-Calibration-Firebase
Hey , If you're looking for code enabling communication between hardware and software, you've come to the right place.

In this project I used ESP8266 for its wifi module and GY-521 MPU, u'll find the calibration part of the IMU in the code including some lines which display the state of the IMU .
so u just have to communicate your modules as follow :

Create a firebase project ( u can see tutos ) and enjoy the show !

Don't forget to change:  // Your WiFi SSID , // Your WiFi Password , // Your Firebase project reference url

Best of luck
